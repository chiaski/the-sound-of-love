I will love you till I die and I will.. but I am sorry it didn't take the pain away. At that moment I was confident it would. My heart was in the right place. I know for that night your heart was there too. Please don't think I don't have any happy memories of you.`,

    "c": `Been hearing this song in my head thinking about the only person I've ever had mutual happiness with and loved more than anyone.

A girl named Lucia. The highlight of my life. When we met, we were seeing each other at our worst, but we connected on a level I've never found in my life. We were both in bad situations but we found so much happiness in each other. From holding hands everywhere, to the little tug of war battles in the stores and elsewhere, to cuddling in bed to watch videos on her phone, to feeding ducks and swinging in the park, and so many more things, every one of them special to me.

I was there for her since the moment we met, and I always will be.

But I said too many dumb things, and things that got misunderstood. I got emotional over small things too much because of my past. I focused too much on being happy and making her happy, so much so that I neglected other priorities which would have helped us both, like making more money so we could move closer to her friends and family. Ultimately that led to her feeling trapped and isolated and emotionally wrecked.

She's young and still figuring a lot of things out, so I don't blame her for anything. I understand the things that made her feel how she felt to leave. I do wish she hadn't let other people get in the way and second-guessed who I am though. She's the only person I've never told a lie to, but I couldn't convince her to trust and believe me over people who speak from a position of "authority" or who have their own motives. But with time, maybe eventually she'll realize these people were wrong.

I wish I could just have a chance to fix myself and make up for my mistakes and try again. I would give anything for that.

Now I feel like I don't matter at all. Every day I'm thinking of her. I wish I wasn't such a broken human being. If only I'd thought of the right words...

I wonder if she misses me as much as I miss her.`,

The last I kissed him, hugged him, felt his presence..He lived with an abusive father and had no mother because she had lost her battle to suicide when he was in middle school. He cried for a mother and craved that bond and love. I was the only on to keep him afloat for years until the one last fight he had with his father..he just couldn't take it anymore.
The last thing I got from him was a message at 1:38 a.m. ‚Äú i love you so much .. and don‚Äôt ever think i don‚Äôt‚Äù i woke up to a flood of messages asking if I had heard the news, am I okay, and if I‚Äôm alive..
I thought it was one of those late night messages, but his best friend called and he said ‚ÄúElizabeth, promise me you will be strong but.... Chris..shot himself last night‚Äù and i hung up Immediately.
I couldn‚Äôt process it , my heart wasn‚Äôt beating, my hands were shaking and i screamed like I‚Äôve never screamed before.I called him well over 40 plus times but..he never answered.

He passed away on January 5th 2019.

He had a polaroid camera and i have a picture of him at the lunchroom and I keep it at my bedside at all times. When he was laid to rest they buried him with a suit that he wore when we went to our last prom,the guitar necklace I gave him for Christmas that December and finally the polaroid picture he took of me at the lockers and they had put it in his pocket close to his heart.

I‚Äôll see you soon my love,my goofball and all.
This song goes out to you Chris and to all who suffer loss but are brought together out of love.

I was best friends with the same girl all the way from back in second grade and we talked constantly and it was fucking great. Along comes sophomore year and my parents divorced, and of course me already suffering from depression went into a whole tail spin. When my mom and I moved into our new apartment the previously mentioned friend helped me move my stuff into my new room in the attic when I finally and genuinely asked her if she wanted to be together and she said yes with this giggle that lit up my world and this look in her eyes that melted my heart. A week later we shared our first kiss and it is a moment that has always been vivid in my mind and I cherish it every day. As time passed we spent every moment we could together along with sordid friends and people from clubs at school, she was in marching band so of course I went to every game so I could see her play and I was in musicals so she always came to my shows. Fast forward to today when I wish I could say this has a happy ending. That we are still together and moving in and things are still amazing but no. Painfully that‚Äôs not the case. The fact that I just found this song reminded me of just how bad I fucked it all up. After two and a half years I left her and it was the dumbest thing I ever did. It was two weeks from prom after she already said yes, a week after my senior show where I told her backstage that everything would be ok, a month after making plans to be together forever. Like an idiot I broke it off and whether it was out of fear or a need to get away for a while I don‚Äôt know. We still talk and we are at the same college now. Things aren‚Äôt the same and I acted like an asshole for a while after which only hurt her more. Now she‚Äôs with a new guy and they are getting along amazingly and I‚Äôm happy for her. Even though it means that even if I wanted we can‚Äôt hang out really cause she‚Äôs too busy between work and the boy friend. Like i said though, not a day goes by where I don‚Äôt think of her or her smile, that giggle, listening to her sing while I‚Äôm pretending to sleep on a road trip, swimming in the summer, vacations in the south, naps after school, Christmas Eve in each other‚Äôs arms, it‚Äôs all still there and it hurts but it‚Äôs beautiful. So yea that‚Äôs a thing. Enjoy the song everyone, keep listening to music it‚Äôs a helluva thing for us all.`,

We spent whole nights talking/texting and then we looked like zombies the day after and since we always sat next to each other I remember my hands always touching her hair lol I loved her more than anything, I always told her that I loved her but for some strange reason even though I knew she felt something she never wanted to be something more, high school was over and I was supposed to kiss her the last day but her mom came to pick her up and everything went to shit. Some days later she was having her birthday, I wrote her but I got some fucked up shit in response then I decided that it was not healthy for me to love her, we stopped talking and we became strangers to each other, couple years ago I met her in the downtown but again we just passed over each other like we never met before, I still think about her even tho it's 4 years now since we left each other.

He had a bad childhood trauma and sadly didn't tell me about it, probably afraid or for any other unknown reasons. But he told his past to a girl he was being close and in the end the girl didn't want to see or talk to him anymore.

All of this and the past trauma brought him to end his own life, and since it's too sudden I can't really processed anything and just ask myself, "Why?"

I kept some of his personal belongings and one of them is his notebook.
He wrote the lyrics to this song. It's quite weird since I thought the lyrics sounds gay (not insulting, I'm not straight too but not into gay relationship). I didn't even bother looking for the song in google, afraid of the emotional surge and all.
2018 and watched Call Me By Your Name and got caught by Sufjan's songs (yeah I know it's too late) and search his other songs on youtube and realized one of them is this song, the one that my friend wrote on his notebook (lyrics on notebook didn't mention Sufjan's name and only had the second part of the song). 

Some times I wish my friend wrote the lyrics for me, but weirdly he never made me listen to this song, probably afraid of being labeled as gay. I never had problem with gay people and he knew it too.

So for now I always thought of him whenever I heard or played this song. Sufjan Stevens is a genius and I'm glad I live in the same time as his works.

And for you Silly Wabbit, happy 34th birthday. I hope you are happy wherever you are.
I love you.

P.S. Sorry for bad English. I feel better now, but still mad at my friend for leaving this world to me. Can't really get mad cause I really like him. It's quite saddening that soul mates can only be together for a brief period of time. 
Whoever read this I hope you're living a happy life too. Live the moment. Believe in your close friend. Tell them you love them.`,

I looked over at my ex and they didn‚Äôt even respond.  They actually hated the song and it was at that moment when I realized that we were never meant to be.  That they would never follow me into the dark.  Flash forward to 4 years later, and I had a first date with someone very special to me. We went to a bar and they had karaoke.  Wouldn‚Äôt you know, this was the song he had chosen to sing!  That special someone is my now husband and we‚Äôre expecting our first child in May! So don‚Äôt give up hope! There is someone for you!`,

That was a hard pill to swallow, im still not in a good place but i have go forge on, to keep her memory alive, her mom finally cleaned out her room, and she sent me a bunch of the love letters that she had written me, honestly i didnt know she felt the same way, im still trying to force the thought that maybe if i had just told her how i felt, maybe we would be together and happy today, my heart still aches but ill keep going i have to.

In high school i asked her out, she screamed when i did and she started crying and i remember her saying "I've been waiting for you to ask, ive liked you since year 1". That night i drove her to the Drive Ins and we watched a movie. Counting Pre school and after high school and college we were together for over 35 years until 7 years ago she was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer, 6 months later she passed away while i was with her, i felt the coldness in her and it spread to me it sent goosebumps down my neck and the grip she had while holding my hand was lost and she whispered to me "thank you for all time we have had together". That night i cried and screamed so hard my body totally collapsed and i passed out. Today me and my kids listen to this song together (6) and (8) years old. I cry to sleep every night knowing that shes never coming back... I want to end it all meet her in heaven but i cant loose my kids and they cant lose me.

Then I started to realize something incredible. I loved her. Seeing her made my heart beat faster, her smile made me feel warm inside. I finally got the courage to confess my feelings to her one day. That morning I wrote her a love letter, putting all of my feelings for her in the form of words. I decided to hand it to her with high hopes. However, I learned that day that she didn‚Äôt care about me. She threw the letter away before even reading it for a second. Our friendship, all the memories we made, they‚Äôre all gone.

What a beautiful corner of the internet did I just discover.
It is so rare to hear so many people acknowledge openly that this life is hard and that we suffer. 
Just scrolling through the comments and reading the stuff people go through, makes it horribly and beautifully apparent that this is so. These comments are from people on the internet, names that point to people, we will likely never meet. But their stories are not individual cases. Not something that is rare. The people you know personally and you yourself have suffered. The intensity of the suffering and the depth of the wounds are not something that sets us apart. We are united in the fact that we love and in the fact that we suffer.

But I want this comment to be ray of sunshine, a slight touch of hope amidst this misery. I don't need to tell y'all why it sucks. You know that. You have lived in this world. We fall apart and what we love does too. This is a fundamental fact of life that needs to be acknowledged. This world is not shaped in a way as to be able to make us happy. Ever.

If you stay here and have only realised this, depression is the result. I acknowledge this and my heart is still not made of stone. 
Nonetheless, I am not depressed. I have found my peace with this way the world is, because I have found something higher than this world.
I am not going to tell you, what it is. Neither am I going to tell you, where I found it, other than: Within myself and all around us. I just want this to be a signpost, saying: There is a way out of this. Because there is. How are you going to find it? I don't know. People are too different for a solution that works for everybody. I know my way and I travelled far enough to be at rest. You are going to find your way, I am certain. 
There have been great souls, showing us various paths toward the Divine. Following a well trodden path is better, than making your own way.
Depression is not the end. It is the beginning of spirituality. The beginning of freedom.

Find that which lasts, in all this change. Everything in this world will disappoint you, but this will not.

I wish you all the best on your journey. I wish you all the peace, love and happiness you deserve.
You will get there one day. You will be free.

Until then, know that someone cares. Know that you are not alone in your suffering.
Read these comments and realise that suffering is a fundamental part of human life.
Beyond all our differences, we are united in love and suffering.

Let there be more love in this world and less suffering."`,

She was going through a lot and I hope shes doing well, I wish things worked out between us‚Ä¶but life happens. This song will always remain with me and I‚Äôll always listen to CAS. These experiences becomes a memory, memories in which I‚Äôm forever grateful for.`,

I recently lost my girlfriend. We were together for 6 full years. I wanted to write this because I felt it was necessary. I needed to get it off my chest. Everything was great in the first year. We had that spark when you meet someone new. Unfortunately, she had got out of a long term relationship from high school and had history with him. She cheated on me the first year. I forgave her because I really wanted to be with her, but to be honest. Ever since then, it went downhill. We had good times but mostly bad because it was in the back of my head for a long time until I got over it. It took me 2-3 years to get over that feeling of not being wanted or loved. I wanted to be perfect for her. Then 3 years into the relationship, we fought more and more and said things we didn‚Äôt mean and regret. She found someone else for like 1-2 months. So it sucked, that she basically cheated again because we weren‚Äôt done. When I found out she was with someone else. I saw her phone, pictures of her naked that were sent. Messages. It hurt like hell, and I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing wrong. Again, like an idiot. I forgave her and we started dating again. Then now that we made 6 years. She started feeling not happy anymore, all we did was fight. Quarantine didn‚Äôt make it any better. We rarely saw each other. I knew we were at the verge of a cliff. And it sucks. Because I caught her yet again 1 week ago. With her first ex from high school in the car. She looked dead at me. I knew in that moment. Everything was over and done with. She had moved on. The crazy thing about it, was I had just bought her a vase with roses that night and I was going to tell her that she was the one and that I was sorry for not trying anymore. That we could maybe start over. But after seeing something like that, it just kind of kills you. It breaks you in ways that I can‚Äôt describe. She didn‚Äôt even text me or call me after. She just left it like that. Everybody says I deserve better but it still hurts to lose someone you‚Äôve been with for that long. I‚Äôm sorry for writing this. But cigarettes after sex has saved me. From pain and from loneliness because their music helps me calm down and makes me happy. Even though, she did indeed break my heart. I wish her nothing but the best and I hope she finds happiness. Now, I hope to just focus on myself and work hard to do what I want to do. I will keep you guys updated in 6 months-1 year to see how I am doing. Thank you for reading this.`,

We clicked so well and had amazing chemistry and I am really gonna miss her, but she just could not envision me as a husband and we could no longer fight the facts. There were other issues and I did have some shortcomings but ultimately I realized after the breakup that you cant force a relationship and you and the other person deserve to be with someone who can see that future with each other. It doesn't mean they didn't care or didn't love you or didn't try. It just means they were not your person and vice versa. There will be that one in your life you loved more than anything but just because the feelings are there does not fix the underlying problems which we did try and work on.

    "c": `Been hearing this song in my head thinking about the only person I've ever had mutual happiness with and loved more than anyone.

A girl named Lucia. The highlight of my life. When we met, we were seeing each other at our worst, but we connected on a level I've never found in my life. We were both in bad situations but we found so much happiness in each other. From holding hands everywhere, to the little tug of war battles in the stores and elsewhere, to cuddling in bed to watch videos on her phone, to feeding ducks and swinging in the park, and so many more things, every one of them special to me.

I was there for her since the moment we met, and I always will be.

But I said too many dumb things, and things that got misunderstood. I got emotional over small things too much because of my past. I focused too much on being happy and making her happy, so much so that I neglected other priorities which would have helped us both, like making more money so we could move closer to her friends and family. Ultimately that led to her feeling trapped and isolated and emotionally wrecked.

She's young and still figuring a lot of things out, so I don't blame her for anything. I understand the things that made her feel how she felt to leave. I do wish she hadn't let other people get in the way and second-guessed who I am though. She's the only person I've never told a lie to, but I couldn't convince her to trust and believe me over people who speak from a position of "authority" or who have their own motives. But with time, maybe eventually she'll realize these people were wrong.

I wish I could just have a chance to fix myself and make up for my mistakes and try again. I would give anything for that.

Now I feel like I don't matter at all. Every day I'm thinking of her. I wish I wasn't such a broken human being. If only I'd thought of the right words...

I wonder if she misses me as much as I miss her.`,

I was best friends with the same girl all the way from back in second grade and we talked constantly and it was fucking great. Along comes sophomore year and my parents divorced, and of course me already suffering from depression went into a whole tail spin. When my mom and I moved into our new apartment the previously mentioned friend helped me move my stuff into my new room in the attic when I finally and genuinely asked her if she wanted to be together and she said yes with this giggle that lit up my world and this look in her eyes that melted my heart. A week later we shared our first kiss and it is a moment that has always been vivid in my mind and I cherish it every day. As time passed we spent every moment we could together along with sordid friends and people from clubs at school, she was in marching band so of course I went to every game so I could see her play and I was in musicals so she always came to my shows. Fast forward to today when I wish I could say this has a happy ending. That we are still together and moving in and things are still amazing but no. Painfully that’s not the case. The fact that I just found this song reminded me of just how bad I fucked it all up. After two and a half years I left her and it was the dumbest thing I ever did. It was two weeks from prom after she already said yes, a week after my senior show where I told her backstage that everything would be ok, a month after making plans to be together forever. Like an idiot I broke it off and whether it was out of fear or a need to get away for a while I don’t know. We still talk and we are at the same college now. Things aren’t the same and I acted like an asshole for a while after which only hurt her more. Now she’s with a new guy and they are getting along amazingly and I’m happy for her. Even though it means that even if I wanted we can’t hang out really cause she’s too busy between work and the boy friend. Like i said though, not a day goes by where I don’t think of her or her smile, that giggle, listening to her sing while I’m pretending to sleep on a road trip, swimming in the summer, vacations in the south, naps after school, Christmas Eve in each other’s arms, it’s all still there and it hurts but it’s beautiful. So yea that’s a thing. Enjoy the song everyone, keep listening to music it’s a helluva thing for us all.`,

We spent whole nights talking/texting and then we looked like zombies the day after and since we always sat next to each other I remember my hands always touching her hair lol I loved her more than anything, I always told her that I loved her but for some strange reason even though I knew she felt something she never wanted to be something more, high school was over and I was supposed to kiss her the last day but her mom came to pick her up and everything went to shit. Some days later she was having her birthday, I wrote her but I got some fucked up shit in response then I decided that it was not healthy for me to love her, we stopped talking and we became strangers to each other, couple years ago I met her in the downtown but again we just passed over each other like we never met before, I still think about her even tho it's 4 years now since we left each other.

He had a bad childhood trauma and sadly didn't tell me about it, probably afraid or for any other unknown reasons. But he told his past to a girl he was being close and in the end the girl didn't want to see or talk to him anymore.

All of this and the past trauma brought him to end his own life, and since it's too sudden I can't really processed anything and just ask myself, "Why?"

I kept some of his personal belongings and one of them is his notebook.
He wrote the lyrics to this song. It's quite weird since I thought the lyrics sounds gay (not insulting, I'm not straight too but not into gay relationship). I didn't even bother looking for the song in google, afraid of the emotional surge and all.
2018 and watched Call Me By Your Name and got caught by Sufjan's songs (yeah I know it's too late) and search his other songs on youtube and realized one of them is this song, the one that my friend wrote on his notebook (lyrics on notebook didn't mention Sufjan's name and only had the second part of the song). 

Some times I wish my friend wrote the lyrics for me, but weirdly he never made me listen to this song, probably afraid of being labeled as gay. I never had problem with gay people and he knew it too.

So for now I always thought of him whenever I heard or played this song. Sufjan Stevens is a genius and I'm glad I live in the same time as his works.

And for you Silly Wabbit, happy 34th birthday. I hope you are happy wherever you are.
I love you.

P.S. Sorry for bad English. I feel better now, but still mad at my friend for leaving this world to me. Can't really get mad cause I really like him. It's quite saddening that soul mates can only be together for a brief period of time.

That was a hard pill to swallow, im still not in a good place but i have go forge on, to keep her memory alive, her mom finally cleaned out her room, and she sent me a bunch of the love letters that she had written me, honestly i didnt know she felt the same way, im still trying to force the thought that maybe if i had just told her how i felt, maybe we would be together and happy today, my heart still aches but ill keep going i have to. I love you elizabeth, and theres not a damn thing you can do about it..`,

(i’ve only experienced toxic love before) which made me too afraid to allow myself to love him back. i didnt know how to accept such love im not used to. he always asked me to take a chance with him, and i always replied “im too afraid to lose you and i cant afford that” thing is, he never knew i was more afraid to love him than to lose him. but in losing him, i realized i’ve loved him. i loved him. i love him. but i never got to tell him that, i never got to tell him that when i asked him if he ever met someone he genuinely wanted to spend the rest of his life with that i hoped i’d be his answer because he was mine. he was someone i saw myself wanting to spend the rest of my life with... but now every year his death anniversary is a day before my birthday reminding me of how he never got to celebrate it with me like he said he would. hope when our souls reunite one day, i tell him how much i loved him. tell him i’m sorry that his last text msg was “please reply”, i’m sorry i watched my phone ring without picking up. i’m sorry that our last phone call was short. i’m sorry i didn’t hold him tighter the night that was our last. your soul is with me always. i carry you with me everywhere i go and no time would ever erase or replace you. you’re a part of me, and one day ill be able to tell you myself.

he died in his sleep.

rest your heart and soul in peace, my angel Hussam. until we meet again.`,

I remember how you asked me to stay alive for you during my suicidal days because I felt a deep emptiness, that was nothing compared to what I felt when you passed. I promised myself to stay alive to keep your memory burning bright, and I do not think negatively of you, nor will call you a hypocrite. You were so optimistic and saw the bright side of everything. I hate your ex boyfriend that beat you, I hate your parents for always bickering and neglecting you, and I hate the pills that took you from this world. But I love you for the art of forgiveness you taught me. I lost you before you were mine and all I want to do is see your face again and hear your voice, but the world had different plans. Nevertheless I love you and I know I’ll see you again one day but I’m gonna keep going not just because of the promise but for myself as well. This life is here because of you, thank you.

Though we are both still alive, we are both unwell. There will come a time where one of us will pass and leave the other to carry on our legacy.
